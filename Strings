Program1:-
#There are 50 students in the class. The teacher wants to arrange them in the height order. So help the teacher to find the smallest person and tallest 
to arrange.(count the number of lowercase letters and uppercase letters in a string.) Problem Description The program takes a string and counts the number
of lowercase letters and uppercase letters in the string. Problem Solution
1. Take a string from the user and store it in a variable.
2. Initialize the two count variables to 0. 
3. Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the first count variable each time a lowercase character 
is encountered and increment the second count variable each time a uppercase character is encountered.
4. Print the total count of both the variables.
5. Exit.

n = input()
l=0
u=0
for i in n:
    if i>='a' and i<='z':
        l=l+1
    else:
        u=u+1
print(u)
print(l)

Program2:-
#Write a  Python Program to calculate the number of words and characters present in a string.
n = input()
count=1
c=0
for i in n:
    if i==" ":
        count+=1
        c+=1
    else:
        c+=1
print(count)
print(c)

Program3:-
#Write a Python Program to calculate the number of digits and letters in a string. Problem Description The program takes a string and calculates the
number of digits and letters in a string. Problem Solution 
1. Take a string from the user and store it in a variable. 
2. Initialize the two count variables to 0. 
3. Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the first count variable each time a digit is encountered 
and increment the second count variable each time a character is encountered.
4. Print the total count of both the variables.
5. Exit.

str = input()
d = 0
l =0
for i in str:
    if i>='a' and i<='z':
        l+=1
    elif i>='A' and i<='Z':
        l+=1
    else:
        d+=1
print("Characters =",l)
print("Digits =",d)

Program4:-
#Write a python code to arrange the characters in ascending order of the given String
str = input()
result=''.join(sorted(str))
print(result)

Program5:-
#Write a Python Program to form a new string made of the first 2 characters and last 2 characters from a given string. 
Problem Description The program takes a string and forms a new string made of the first 2 characters and last 2 characters from a given string.
Problem Solution 1. Take a string from the user and store it in a variable.
2. Initialize a count variable to 0. 
3. Use a for loop to traverse through the characters in the string and increment the count variable each time.
4. Form the new string using string slicing.
5. Print the newly formed string.
6. Exit.

str=input()
count=0
for i in str:
    count=count+1
print(str[0:2]+str[count-2:count])

Program6:-
#Write a Python Program to remove the nth index character from a non-empty string.
n = input()
i = int(input())
print(n[:i]+n[i+1:])

Program7:-
#Write a Python Program to replace all occurrences of â€˜aâ€™ with â€˜$â€™ in a string.
str=input()
alphabet= input()
r =input()
result = str.replace(alphabet,r)
print("Modified string:")
print(result)
