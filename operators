Program6:-
The college ground is rectangular in shape. The Management decides to build a fence around the ground. In order to help the construction workers to build a straight fence, 
they planned to place a thick rope around the ground. They wanted to buy only the exact length of the rope that is needed.
They also wanted to cover the entire ground with a thick carpet during rainy season. They wanted to buy only the exact quantity of carpet that is needed. 
They requested your help. Can you please help them by writing a program to find the exact length of the rope and the exact quantity of carper that is required?

Program9:-
# During the Physical Education hour, PET sir has decided to conduct some team games. He wants to split the students in the class into equal sized teams. 
# In some cases, there may be some students who are left out from teams and he wanted to use the left out students to assist him in conducting the team games. 
# For instance, if there are 50 students in the class and if the class has to be divided into 7 equal sized teams, 7 students will be there in each team and
# 1 student will be left out. PET sir asks your help to automate this team splitting task. Can you please help him out?

Program10:-
# Ajay, Binoy and Chandru were very close friends at school. They were very good in Mathematics and they were the pet students of Emily Mam.
# Their gang was known as 3-idiots. Ajay, Binoy and Chandru live in the same locality. A new student Dinesh joins their class and he wanted to be friends with them.
# He asked Binoy about his house address. Binoy wanted to test Dinesh's mathematical skills. Binoy told Dinesh that his house is at the midpoint of the line joining Ajay's house
# and Chandru's house. Dinesh was puzzled. Can you help Dinesh out? Given the coordinates of the 2 end points of a line (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), write a python program to find the midpoint of the line.
